# storage


Storage is a simple service that acts as an agnostic storage solution.
The primay purpose of this service is the ability to quickly spin up a containerized database that can have arbitrary backends. Later backends can be defined without affecting existing services. 


To get started:
`make init`

Proto output should be generated but not checked in.
